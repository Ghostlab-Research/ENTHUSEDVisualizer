All of the scripts necessary for running the visualizer for ENTHUSED (Engine for Negotiating the Timing of Hints Using Spatiotemporal Evaluation Data) which has since evolved into DEPTH (Design Evaluation using Position Tracking and Highlighting). 
The Logger, which records the position of objects while the game is being playtested, is in Assets/Scripts. 
The jupyter notebook will take the output from the logger and process it into a series of matrixes that the visualizer can represent in Unity.
